# Nextflow Linter

A command-line tool for linting **Nextflow scripts** to detect syntax and semantic issues. Powered by the excellent **Nextflow Language Server tools**.

> **IMPORTANT:**  
> I wrote this mostly for fun, to learn a bit of Groovy, but it could be useful. The Seqera folks will add a linter of sorts into Nextflow itself at some point, so I won't maintain this tool in the long run.

---

## Features

This tool should print exactly the same errors and warnings as the Nextflow VS Code extension.

It supports individual `.nf` files or to recursively lint all `.nf` files in a directory.

> **Note:**  
> It doesn't support configuration files yet, but I may add that at some point.

The linter will exit with code `1` if there is at least one error.
